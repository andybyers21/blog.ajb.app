#### Built-in shortcodes

- **`image`** (prop required: **`src`**; props optional: **`alt`**, **`position`** (**left** is default | center | right), **`style`**)
  - eg: `{{< image src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}`
- **`figure`** (same as `image`, plus few optional props: **`caption`**, **`captionPosition`** (left | **center** is default | right), **`captionStyle`**
  - eg: `{{< figure src="/img/hello.png" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" caption="Hello Friend!" captionPosition="right" captionStyle="color: red;" >}}`
- **`imgproc`** Hugo shortcode for image processing, plus additional **`position`** param [ left | center | right ] (optional).
  - eg: `{{< imgproc "img/hello.png" Resize "250x" center />}}`
  - More detailed info on processing commands at [https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/](https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/)
- **`code`** (prop required: **`language`**; props optional: **`title`**, **`id`**, **`expand`** (default "â–³"), **`collapse`** (default "â–½"), **`isCollapsed`**)

  - eg:

  ```go
  {{< code language="css" title="Really cool snippet" id="1" expand="Show" collapse="Hide" isCollapsed="true" >}}
  pre {
    background: #1a1a1d;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    font-size: 1rem;
    overflow: auto;

    @media (--phone) {
      white-space: pre-wrap;
      word-wrap: break-word;
    }

    code {
      background: none !important;
      color: #ccc;
      padding: 0;
      font-size: inherit;
    }
  }
  {{< /code >}}
  ```

## How to run your site

From your Hugo root directory run:

```
$ hugo serve
```

and go to `localhost:1313` in your browser. From now on all the changes you make will go live, so you don't need to refresh your browser every single time.

## How to configure

The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration. Just copy:

```toml
baseurl = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
theme = "hello-friend"
paginate = 5

[params]
  # dir name of your blog content (default is `content/posts`).
  # the list of set content will show up on your index page (baseurl).
  contentTypeName = "posts"

  # "light" or "dark"
  defaultTheme = "dark"

  # if you set this to 0, only submenu trigger will be visible
  showMenuItems = 2

  # Show reading time in minutes for posts
  showReadingTime = false

  # Show table of contents at the top of your posts (defaults to false)
  # Alternatively, add this param to post front matter for specific posts
  # toc = true

  # Show full page content in RSS feed items
  #(default is Description or Summary metadata in the front matter)
  # rssFullText = true

[languages]
  [languages.en]
    title = "Hello Friend"
    subtitle = "A simple theme for Hugo"
    keywords = ""
    copyright = ""
    menuMore = "Show more"
    writtenBy = "Written by"
    readMore = "Read more"
    readOtherPosts = "Read other posts"
    newerPosts = "Newer posts"
    olderPosts = "Older posts"
    minuteReadingTime = "min read"
    dateFormatSingle = "2006-01-02"
    dateFormatList = "2006-01-02"
    # leave empty to disable, enter display text to enable
    # lastModDisplay = ""

    [languages.en.params.logo]
      logoText = "hello friend"
      logoHomeLink = "/"
    # or
    #
    # path = "/img/your-example-logo.svg"
    # alt = "Your example logo alt text"

    [languages.en.menu]
      [[languages.en.menu.main]]
        identifier = "about"
        name = "About"
        url = "/about"
      [[languages.en.menu.main]]
        identifier = "showcase"
        name = "Showcase"
        url = "/showcase"
```

to `config.toml` file in your Hugo root directory and change params fields. In case you need, here's [a YAML version](https://gist.github.com/panr/8f9b363e358aaa33f6d353c77feee959).

**NOTE:** Please keep in mind that currently main menu doesn't support nesting.

## How to add a cover image to your posts

Adding a cover image to your post is simple and there are two options when you edit your `index.md` file in `content/posts/blog-entry-xy/index.md`:

- Use `cover = "/path/to/absolute/img.jpg"` to link an absolute image
  - Resulting in `https://www.yourpage.com/path/to/absolute/img.jpg`
- Use `cover = "img.jpg"` and `useRelativeCover = true` to link the image relative to the blog post folder
  - Resulting in `https://www.yourpage.com/posts/blog-entry-xy/img.jpg`
- Use `coverAlt = "description of image"` to add custom alt text to the cover image (defaults to post or page title as alt text)
- Use `coverCaption = "Image Credit to [Barry Bluejeans](https://unsplash.com/)"` to add a caption for the cover image.

## How to display the Last Modified Date in your posts

Add `lastModDisplay = "[your display text]"` to `config.toml` to enable last modified date on your posts. Note - an empty string value `""` does not display anything.

Example: `lastModDisplay = "Modified:"` --> "Modified: Jan 01, 0001"

:octocat: Hugo's `enableGitInfo` option is a nice complement to this feature.

## Add-ons

- **Archive** â€” Theme has built-in `archive` page for main content (see `contentTypeName` variable in config). If you need archive on your blog just copy https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend/blob/master/exampleSite/content/archive.md to your `content` dir. If you need multilangual archives, duplicate `content/archive.md` and add `.Lang` variable, eg: `content/archive.pl.md` (remember to change `url` in duplicated file).
- **Comments** â€” for adding comments to your blog posts please take a look at `layouts/partials/comments.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/blob/master/layouts/partials/comments.html.
- **Prepended `<head>`** â€” if you need to add something inside `<head>` element, and before any of the theme's `<script>` and `<link>` tags are declared, please take a look at `layouts/partial/prepended_head.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend/blob/master/layouts/partials/prepended_head.html
- **Extended `<head>`** â€” if you need to add something inside `<head>` element, after all of all of the theme's `<script>` and `<link>` tags are declared, please take a look at `layouts/partial/extended_head.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend/blob/master/layouts/partials/extended_head.html
- **Extended `<footer>`** â€” if you need to add something before end of `<body>` element, please take a look at `layouts/partial/extended_footer.html` https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend/blob/master/layouts/partials/extended_footer.html
